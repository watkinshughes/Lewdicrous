#LEWDICROUS

In <em>Lewdicrous</em>,  <a href="http://www.sallyheller.com/" target="_blank">Sally Heller</a> and <a href="http://www.babe-rental.com/" target="_blank">Nina Schwanse</a> explore the language of sexuality through the ubiquitous symbol of the sex goddess. Presented in voluptuous yet evasive poses, this modern day idol speaks of forbidden promises and impending desire. Through still images and video, both artists focus on the choreographed gesture of the female as she addresses her audience.
